# Biases in CV review in ChatGPT

This repository contains experimental results described in the report *D. Platt, M. Platt: Biases in CV review in ChatGPT*.
The report can be found as the file `chatgpt-cv-bias.pdf` in the repository.
Abstract from the report:

> We investigate if ChatGPT is biased against certain ethnicities, sexes, or age groups when scoring CVs.
>    We study this by letting ChatGPT rate 8,000 small variations of CVs.
    We find a statistically significant bias against old applicants but no other significant bias.
>    We further find that asking ChatGPT to explain its reasoning sometimes increases and sometimes decreases bias.
