This repository contains experimental results described in the report *D. Platt, M. Platt: Biases in CV review in ChatGPT*.
The report can be found as the file `chatgpt-cv-bias.pdf` in the repository.

The scores are recorded and used to investigate whether ChatGPT is biased against certain ethnicities, sexes, or age groups.
